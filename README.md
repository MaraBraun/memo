Nemo never forgets

This Project should create an android app to organize your housework, by reminders called purrminder (or Schnurrinerungen in German). And it is named after our cat Nemo just because we love cats.

It is planned to have at least 4 pages in the app.
1. Homepage where all open todos are listed for the actual week
2. Page to plan the next weeks tasks out of a pool of tasks
3. Page to create new tasks with name and potential duration + how often this activity should appear (daily, weekly, every two weeks, monthly,...) + earliest reminder time
4. Page to Edit tasks
